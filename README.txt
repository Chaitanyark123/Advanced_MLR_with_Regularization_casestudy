Advanced regression Analysis

Intent of the Analysis:

A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.

Our motive is to model the relation of the Houses' sale price with the predictor varaibles. The model will be used by the company in understanding the important features which majorly drive the Houses' sale price. Once the important features are identified Surprise Housing can use them to their advantage and improve their Sales.
Also to determine the optimal alpha values in Ridge and Lasso regression model.

The steps followed:
Step 1: Understanding the Data
Step 2: Cleaning the data and EDA
Step 3: Building the Multivariate Linear Regression model.
Step 4: Building Ridge and Lasso Regression models and determine the optimal alpha values.
Step 5: Identifying the important predictors.

Technologies used: Python incorporated with Pandas, Numpy, seaborn modules. Git.

Files contained:
